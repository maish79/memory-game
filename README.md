## How to play the Game

* The player should see 16 grid graycards and a moves counter at the screen on display.
* The player clicks on the cards to find a matching pair.
* After clicking the cards the moves counter starts counting the moves.
* If correctly matched pairs are clicked you get a pop-up alert saying ('you found a match').
* The player should click on the "X" button after the pop-up so as to continue with the game.
* When all cards are correctly matched you get another pop-up saying ('congradulations you win!')
* After the game ends, a restart button becomes visible for playing another round.
* By playing this game the user can test their memory skills in a fun environment.
